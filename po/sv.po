"Pisi Linux is a fork of the (PiSi-based) Pardus operating system and its "
"unique technologies. When it became apparent early in 2012 that for "
"political/financial reasons, Pardus was to be abandoned, a small group of "
"Turkish volunteers came together to preserve the unique features of Pardus. "
"The name of this project is Anka (Phoenix). Initially the Anka-Team believed "
"the fork could be named Pardus-Anka. Ultimately this was not possible - "
"hence re-branding to Pisi Linux as a reference to Pardus and its package "
"system PiSi (Pisi is Turkish for kitty).&lt;br&gt;Aside from technical "
"innovation, Pardus had a reputation for stability and ease of use. Our aim "
"therefore, in maintaining and promoting original Pardus technologies is to "
"provide an up to date, unique and technically elegant OS, which is also "
"stable and user-friendly."
